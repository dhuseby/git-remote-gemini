# git-remote-gemini

This is a Git remote helper that allows for basic cloning of git repos over the
Gemini protocol. Build it and install it in your $PATH somewhere and then run
`git clone gemini://<domain>/<repo>.git`

You must be running a Gemini server that detects a Git repo and understands the
following queries:

## List

`gemini://<domain>/<repo>.git?list`

The server must respond with the output of:

`git for-each-ref --format=%(objectname) %(refname) refs/heads/`

and with an optional line indicating the default branch (e.g. `master`) in this
format:
`@refs/heads/<branch> HEAD`

and ending with an empty line.

## Fast Export

`gemini://<domain>/<repo>.git?fast-export=<ref>`

The server must respond with the output of:

`git fast-export <rev>`

## Notes

This does not support marks files or refspecs yet. It is just a "dumb" clone
method as mentioned in the Git documentation.
